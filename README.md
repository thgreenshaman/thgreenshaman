->I’m interested in all things technology related although most of my focus is on self hosting, automation design and robotics.
  I enjoy playing around with Python, Arduino and web development and occasionally find myself designing 3d models for 3d printing projects.
  I have experience with a small amount of bash scripting which is improved daily.
  Over the years I have developed a major passion for linux based operating systems and free and open source software.
  I’m currently learning networking security and web development and am always studying to improve my coding methods and learn new things.
  
  I’m looking to collaborate on anything that gives me more hands on experience.
